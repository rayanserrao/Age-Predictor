# Age-Predictor
The program will predict the age based on the date of birth or age you provide

It will print "you are the oldest person alive" if the age is more than 100

If the given birth year is more than 2020, it will print "you are not born yet"

It will also give an option to the user, if he/she wants to predict thier age in future years.
